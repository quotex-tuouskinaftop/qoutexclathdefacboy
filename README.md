## Types of Quotex Trading Patterns

1.  ### 2 GREEN 2 RED PATTERN (LIVE MARKET)

    If the market respects the resistance level, strikes and takes
    reversal, the next candle will be Red color following the first Red
    candle.

2.  ### SIDE WAYS PATTERN (LIVE MARKET)

    If 1st Candle is Green color, 2nd Candle is Red color & 3rd Candle
    is Green color with a "wick breaking down," then the 4th candle will
    be a sure shot in Red color.

3.  ### OTC MARKET -- 9 CANDLE PATTERN (OTC MARKET)

    This Pattern works in either Uptrend or Downtrend. In Downtrend, if
    you find 8 candles back to back Red color, then the 9th Candle will
    be a sure shot in Red color. In Uptrend, if we find 8 candles back
    to back Green candles, then the 9th Candle will be a sure shot in
    Green color.

4.  ### 1 RED 2 GREEN PATTERN (LIVE MARKET)

    1st Red candle's tail should be longer than the 2nd Green candle's
    Head, which will make the 3rd candle as Green & a sure shot in UP
    direction.

5.  ### SIDE WAY PATTERN (LIVE MARKET)

    2 Red candles (Back to Back) but the head (wick) of 2nd Red Candle
    should not break out by 1st Red Candle, then 3rd Candle will be
    Green, and 4th Candle will be our sure shot as Red Candle. Note:
    Tail (Wick) of first 2 Red Candles should be Longer.
